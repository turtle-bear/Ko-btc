- How selecting stages to clear works. Instead of selecting stage ids you enter a stage to complete the progress to (e.g entering 5 clears the first 5 stages, and entering 48 clears them all and then if you then enter 5 again it will clear the level progress for the levels 6-48)

## [2.1.0] - 2022-08-16

#### Added

- The ability to unlock the equip menu

- The ability to upload catfood and other bannable item changes to the ponos servers - this is done automatically whenever your save data is saved / uploaded. This should in theory prevent bans from catfood and other items, but it seems a bit unreliable so I've kept the warning in the editor

- A feature to claim all user rank rewards (Doesn't give any items)

- A way to select specific gacha banner cats - you need to go to the wiki for the banner you want, and look at the name of the image e.g royal fest = 602

- The ability to get the gold pass

- A feature to create a new account - new iq and token

- A way to clear specific aku stages

- Some configuration options , e.g options to remove max limits, automatically save changes after each edit, etc, the path to the config file is shown at the top of the editor

#### Changed

- You can now exit, catfood, rare, plat, and legend tickets after the warning is shown

- The editor will now display "Press enter to exit" when exiting

- Whenever your inquiry code changes, the editor will upload your catfood and other bannable item amounts to the servers - this should prevent bans

- When entering a transfer code, the editor will check for a hex number and when entering a confirmation code it will check for a dec number. This should prevent people confusing 0 for O

- Game data will now be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/fieryhenry/BCData) when needed so that if I want to update the data in the editor, I don't have to do a new release

#### Fixed

- Select cats based on rarity being off by 1
- Evolve cats setting some cats to the first form

## [2.0.2] - 2022-07-08

#### Fixed

- Jp not being able to upload save data

## [2.0.1] - 2022-07-04

#### Fixed

- Upgrade cats and unlock event stages not working properly when editing all at once

## [2.0.0] - 2022-07-04

#### Added

- The ability to upload your save data to the ponos servers and get transfer and confirmation codes. (The editor's root requirement is now gone). Although, you'll still need root access if you get banned / elsewhere popup. I haven't tested the feature too much so it could lead to bans

- An option to go back in the feature menu

- An automatic updater, if there is a new update, it will ask if you want to update and if you say yes then it'll try to update automatically

- A way to select `all` talent orbs to edit all at once

- A new tutorial video that shows you how to use the transfer system stuff and unban an account [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr6VaLTXOSY)

#### Changed

- The fix elsewhere / unban feature, it no longer needs another account. You can still use the old one, now named `Old Fix elsewhere error / Unban account (needs 2 save files)` if you want

- A bunch of the source code. You should now be able to import BCSFE_Python in another python file and access the parser, serialiser, etc. Due to the rewrite, some stuff may be broken. This, and testing, is where the majority of the time went to

- The order of few options, to make the server stuff closer to the top as that's what most people will be selecting now that no root is needed

#### Fixed

- Some adb issues

- More save parsing issues

- Edit dojo score crashing if you haven't been to the dojo yet

- Adding adb to path issue

- Ototo cat cannon not setting the correct value when editing all at once

## [1.7.0] - 2022-05-20

#### Added

- The ability to clear catnip challenges / missions

- The ability to set the Catclaw dojo score (only `Hall of Initiates` atm - don't know if ranked stuff can be save edited)
- The ability to remove the `Clear "{stage_name}" for a chance to get the Special unit {cat_name}` stage clear rewards when entering Legend Stages
- The ability to set the `maxed upgrades --> rare tickets` conversion thing to allow for unbannable rare tickets to be generated. Run the `trade progress` feature, enter the number of rare tickets you want, go into game and press the `Use All` button in cat storage and then press `Trade for Ticket` . There appears to be nothing in your storage because there is an unobtainable blue upgrade / special skill between `power` and `range` and the editor adds that to your storage to allow you to use the `trade` thing, although any other blue upgrade also works, as long as it is max level.
